## Description
This is a simple jump game that can be greatly improved. A little pink mushroom character runs on a field across a blue sky background must jump over obsticles(tree stumps) the goal in mind is to beat the highscore. Its a reptivie game with no pressure, the user jumps using the space bar and restarts the game with the r key. if the mushroom collides with a stump its game over.

Very simple shapes were used for everything which is one of the key things that could be fixed as well as other issues including the score board.
